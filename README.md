# HWRT - Hand written receipt text extractor.
This was a school project for a research project.

The point of the project was to be the start for further research into this space. 

This is an android application that uses multiple tensorflow models to recognize hand written character on receipts received by farmers
to track their expenses without having to manually type it in the android app.

-- A full description on how this was done and what further research needs to be done will be added soon. --
